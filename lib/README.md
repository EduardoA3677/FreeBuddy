# Hi!!!!!! 👋👋👋👋👋

You're coding and want to help out/explore around here? That's great!!!

Okay, so - UI code is as pure-flutter-future-stream as possible, and most stuff has comments/documentation, so just look
around and read those 👍

Interesting rev-eng stuff is in `headphones/` folder, and there is
dedicated [headphones/README.md](headphones/README.md) - head there 🫡

# Development notes - philosophies, TODOs etc

## Migration to framework-ish organisation

TODO:

- [X] Implement basic stuff (ANC + battery)
- [X] Change ui to work at all with new stuff
- [ ] Implement hp settings
  This is non trivial cause we have to decide how to make this universal when almost all headphones have this different
- [X] Change ui BIG to dynamically support *all* headphones by their features instead of concrete model -> pretty much
  done?
- [ ] Support multiple diff/same headphones
    - [ ] Basic fix in connection loops to show them at all
    - [ ] Basic fix in widget to maybe show their name to distinguish which ones are shown now
      Currently, widget just creates the cubit, wait until it connects, and gets the battery. What if there are
      multiple headphones? Right now it just... gets the first one 🤷
    - [ ] Some database stuf... ehhhh... to distinguish between them, remember their last time etc
      This is potentially waaayyy ahead todo as it requires *serious* decisions that will affect *everything* wayyy
      ahead in later development, so better not fuck it up
        - [ ] Selecting headphones when making new widget
- [ ] Tests for everything

## Future features:

- [ ] Detect hp colors and assign proper image
- [ ] ANC control widget
  This will require whole big background stuff, so that's far offs
