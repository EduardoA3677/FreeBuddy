# Headphones Module Refactoring

This module has been refactored to make it easier to add new headphones models in the future.

## Key Changes

1. **Model Definition System**:

   - Created a unified model definition system in `model_definition/` directory
   - Each model's capabilities are defined in `huawei_models.dart`

2. **Modularized Features**:

   - Each feature (ANC, Double-Tap, Hold gesture, etc.) is now in a separate file
   - Features are in `huawei/features/` directory

3. **Implementation Changes**:

   - Replaced model-specific implementation with generic implementation
   - Implementation is driven by model definitions

4. **Upgrading Process**:
   - To add a new model, simply add a new definition in `huawei_models.dart`
   - No need to create separate implementation files for each model

## Files to Delete

The following files are no longer needed and can be deleted:

- `huawei/freebudspro3.dart`
- `huawei/freebudspro3_impl.dart`
- `huawei/freebudspro3_sim.dart`

## Migration Guide

If you had custom code in any of the deleted files, you should:

1. Check if the functionality is already covered by the new system
2. If not, consider adding it as a feature module in `huawei/features/`
3. Update the model definition to include your feature
